📌 Note:
Using Core Java components and concepts, we can develop Non-Server Applications or Stand-Alone Applications.
❓ FAQ: What are Stand-Alone Applications?
Applications installed and executed on a single computer without server support.

🌐 Advanced Java Technologies
Advanced Java helps in developing server-based or web applications using:
1.	JDBC – Java Database Connectivity
2.	Servlets – Server-side programs to handle requests and responses
3.	JSP – Java Server Pages for dynamic content generation
❓ FAQ: What are Server-based Applications?
Applications executed in a server environment.

🗃️ Day 2: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
❓ FAQ: What is Storage?
Memory location where data is stored and accessed.
🔸 Types of Storage in Java:
1.	Field Storage
o	Holds single data values
o	Created by primitive datatypes
o	Can be:
	Class level → static variable
	Object level → instance variable
	Method level → local variable
Example:
int k = 10;
2.	Object Storage
o	Holds group members
o	Created by non-primitive datatypes: Class, Interface, Array, Enum
Example:
class Addition {
    static int a;
    int b;
    void add() {
        int c = a + b;
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}

Addition ad = new Addition();
Addition.a = 13;
ad.b = 14;
ad.add();  // Output: 27

🧠 Types of Objects in Core Java
1.	User-defined Class Objects
2.	String Objects
o	String, StringBuffer, StringBuilder
3.	Wrapper Class Objects
o	Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Character, Boolean
4.	Array Objects
o	Arrays of user-defined, strings, wrappers, jagged arrays, mixed objects
5.	Collection Objects
o	List: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector → Stack
o	Queue: PriorityQueue, Deque → ArrayDeque, LinkedList
o	Set: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
6.	Map Objects
o	HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable
7.	Enum Objects
